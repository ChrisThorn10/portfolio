# Hi There! I'm Christie ðŸ‘‹
I'm a CRM Tech Marketer with over 10 year's experience.  I truly enjoy working in the CRM space as it is ever evolving and presents unique challenges that I find fascinating. I enjoy roles that require a mix of both technical and marketing knowledge, collaborating with my teammates, learning different aspects of the business, and finding solutions that have a tangible impact.  I am a documentation enthusiast because I believe capturing and sharing knowledge truly empowers the team. Also, writing things down means you won't forget them later! 

Now for the fun stuff! I am an East Coast native who recently moved to the West Coast. I enjoy painting and taking long walks outside. I have a dog and a cat; I've also adopted a couple of squirrels who come by daily for walnuts and almonds.  I am learning French (you can learn so much about a culture by learning the language), I enjoy going to plays, and I love supporting small locally owned restaurants and bakeries. I made just one new year's resolution for 2025: to do 1 pullup. Wish me luck!
