# Hi There! I'm Christie ðŸ‘‹
I'm a CRM Marketer with over 10 year's experience.  I truly enjoy working in the CRM space as it is ever evolving and presents unique challenges that I find fascinating. I enjoy roles that require a mix of both technical and marketing knowledge. I enjoy collaborating with my teammates, learning different aspects of the business, and finding solutions that have a tangible impact.  I am a documentation enthusiast because I believe in the democratization of knowledge. Also writing things down means you won't forget them later! 

Now for the fun stuff! I am an East Coast native who recently moved to the West Coast. I enjoy painting and going for long walks outside. I have a dog, a cat, and I've also adopted a couple of squirrels who comes by daily for walnuts and almonds.  I am learning french (you can learn so much about a culture by learning the language), I enjoy going to plays, and I love supporting local restaurants and bakeries. Lastly, just wanted to brag that I didn't use ChapGPT to write any of this!
