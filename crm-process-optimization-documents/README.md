# Process optimization documents
Here are some examples of the documents I use for project intake, organization, and execution.

* [QA Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HqPSlt1MMu0Y3mEEJ4dq0WQvXdIHXPFbVRRW0KWt2UA/edit?tab=t.0)
* [Marketing CRM Campaign Intake Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HXA8pzsG0kDC8xnVeAW3nLVz4VTbyUG0xN-vtDdo1yY/edit?tab=t.0)
* [CRM Ecosystem Event Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yscK0yls7kBsT6gGQNxsCbU4qgPSWTp8doXi1KAf92s/edit?usp=sharing)

## Other document and tools I like to use
* Project Requirements - When working with eng, I like to clearly define the ask and the success requirement for a project.
* Process Mapping - map out the flow of data for campaigns that require new or exhaustive technical components.
* Technical System Mapping - map out the tech stack for the CRM Ecosystem, noting connections, limitations, and quirks.
* Knowledge Base - maintain a repository of technical guides, historical information, standards, useful SQL queries, ect.
* Post Project Reviews - What went well, what can we do better?
